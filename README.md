# Cryptography

Cryptography is a method of developing techniques and protocols to prevent a
third party from accessing and gaining knowledge of the data from the private messages during a communication process.
Blockchains make use of two types of cryptographic algorithms, asymmetric-key algorithms, and hash functions. Hash functions are used to provide the functionality of a single view of blockchain to every participant.

So a good understanding of cryptographic techniques is important in developing secure blockchain solutions.
